\begin{abstract}
This report aims to solve a series of challenges set by D. A. Nicole and B. Halak\cite{instructions}, aiming for both thoroughness of methodology and accuracy of solution.  The cryptographic decryption challenges demonstrate the use of Python as a useful tool to create automated cipher decryption systems.

\section{Linear feedback shift register}

The problem set forth in this challenge is to decrypt a block of what appears to be a block of data encoded as hexadecimal.

The first thing to note about the cypher-text is that it is presented as a bitmap. After some analysis, not discussed in this report, this bitmap appears to contain no information encoded using stegonographic techniques.  The second, is that there is a repeating pattern of high bits that repeats every 32 bits.

\subsection{Building an LFSR}
Because a hint with this question identifies an LFSR as an ecryption scheme, and gives away the crib of ``Ur'', a program to brute force all possible LFSR sequences that result in the first characters of the plain-text being ``Ur''.

\paragraph{Outline}
The remainder of this article is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{previous work} gives account of previous work.
Our new and exciting results are described in Section~\ref{results}.
Finally, Section~\ref{conclusions} gives the conclusions.

\section{Previous work}\label{previous work}
A much longer \LaTeXe{} example was written by Gil~\cite{Gil:02}.

\section{Results}\label{results}
In this section we describe the results.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}
We worked hard, and achieved very little.
