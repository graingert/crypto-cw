\section{Linear feedback shift register}

The problem set forth in this challenge is to decrypt what appears to be a block
of hexadecimal encoded data.

The first observation about the cypher-text is that it is presented as a bitmap.
After some analysis, not discussed in this report, the bitmap appears to
contain no information embedded using stegonographic techniques.  The second, is
that there is a pattern of high bits that repeat every 32 bits.

\subsection{Compromising LFSR encryption}
A hint with this question identifies an LFSR as the first encryption scheme, and
gives away the crib of ``Ur''.  Because of this a program, shown in
appendix~\ref{break-lfsr}, was created to brute force all possible LFSR
sequences that result in the first characters of the plain-text being ``Ur''.

The output of this program, when run with arguments\textless{}the
cipher-text\textgreater and ``Ur'', is shown in appendix~\ref{break-lfsr-out}.
This output is clearly incorrect: the output is corrupt after and including the
4th character.  Because only one output it possible with this crib, and LFSR
degree something is wrong with the LFSR implementation.

\subsection{Compromising a buggy LFSR encryption implementation}
An LFSR of degree 5 will repeat every 31 bits, however, referring back to the
second observation of the cipher-text there is a pattern of high bits that
repeats every 32 bits. This observation is clearly contradicts the hint that the
second encryption stage uses an LFSR of degree 5.

A program, shown in appendix~\ref{last-byte}, was created to brute force the
last byte of the repeating 32 bit key, assuming that the first 3 bytes were from
a valid 31 bit LFSR key-stream.

This resulted in only one valid solution: valid as defined by a solution with
only printable characters.  This mid-stage cipher-text, shown in
appendix~\ref{last-byte-out}, shows signs of a mono-alphabetic substitution
cypher: repeated three letter words ``pna'' and ``gur'' potentially indicating
``and'' and ``the'', long repeated words ``Ubjrire'', and valid use of
punctuation such as commas and capitol letters after full-stops. As such this
remaining cipher-text was decrypted using techniques as discussed in
section~\ref{mono}.  The final solution is shown in appendix~\ref{q1-solution}.

\section{Hamming codes and generator polynomials}
\subsection{Part a}
The properties of generator polynomials can be used to determine if a polynomial
is a generator polynomial.  A generator polynomial is also known as a primitive
polynomial and ``primitive polynomials are also irreducible
polynomials''~\cite{wolfram-primative}.  As such any polynomial that can be
factorized modulus 2 is not a generator polynomial.

\begin{description}
    \item[$f1(x) = x^6 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$] is reducible because $f1(x) = (x^2+x+1)(x^4+x^3+1)$.
    \item[$f2(x) = x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1$] is reducible because $f2(x) = (x^2+x+1)(x^4+x+1)$.
    \item[$f3(x) = x^6 + x^5 + x$] is reducible because $f3(x) = x(x^5 + x^4 + 1)$.
    \item[$f4(x) = x^6 + x^5 +x^4 + x^2 +x + 1$] is reducible because $f4(x) = (x^2+x+1)(x+1)^4$.
    \item[$f5(x) = x^6 + x + 1$] is a generator polynomial by elimination.
\end{description}

These justifications can be tested using the two argument version of the
``hammgen'' function from GNU Octave~\cite{hammgen-octave}, also a function
available in MATLAB~\cite{hammgen-matlab}. Using this function it is possible to
determine if a polynomial is a generator polynomial of a hamming code or not:
when a non-generator polynomial is given as the function's second argument an
exception is raised.  A program to test all of the given polynomials is shown in
appendix~\ref{hammgen} concluded that $f5(x)$ is the only generator polynomial
out of the given functions.

\subsection{Part b}
Using the ``hammgen'' function from GNU Octave~\cite{hammgen-octave} a program,
shown in appendix~\ref{hammgen-hg}, was created to output the parity check,
H\label{parity-check}, and generator, G, matrices for $f5(x)$.
See appendix~\ref{h-matrix} for the H matrix and appendix~\ref{g-matrix} for the
G matrix.

\subsection{Part c}

Using the parity check matrix, H, from section~\ref{parity-check} it is possible
to determine if a message is a valid code word: ``In coding theory, a
parity-check matrix of a linear block code C is a generator matrix of the dual
code. As such, a codeword c is in C if and only if the matrix-vector product
$Hc^t = 0$''~\cite{check-matrix}.

A program, included in appendix~\ref{check-matrix} was written to determine that
the valid code words are m1 and m2.

\section{Mono-alphabetic substitution}\label{mono}
In this challenge, another decryption challenge, the requirement is to decrypt a
block of text included in appendix~\ref{q3-cyphertext}. This time there is no
hint provided.

The first clue that the cypher-text is the result of mono-alphabetic
substitution is the use of repeated words such as ``uli'' and ``blf''
potentially indicating the English three letter words ``and'' and ``the''. While
a frequency analysis would also be useful for solving these sorts of cyphers in
general, this was not used because of the success of the automated simple
substitution breaking program.

A program, included in appendix~\ref{break-simplesub}, based on work by
\textcite{stochastic-searching} was used to successfully break the cypher.
The solution is included in appendix~\ref{q3-solution}.

\section{The miss-application of RC4 in WEP and WPA-TKIP}\label{conclusions}

\subsection{Part a}
\subsubsection{What is WEP}
The WEP, or ``Wired Equivalent Privacy'', the security algorithm was released with the original 802.11 standard in 1999\cite{802.11}.  This system is designed to be be responsible for both authentication (access control), encryption (confidentiality) and data integrity in Wi-Fi networks. The name comes from the ``idea'' that it would provide the same security as a wired connection, however according to \textcite{intercepting-wifi}, ``despite employing the well-known and believed-secure RC4 cipher, WEP contains several major security flaws.''.

\subsubsection{RC4}
The RC4 encryption algorithm from RSA Data Security is a stream cipher. Stream ciphers simulate the operation of a one-time-pad using a pseudo random number generator (PRNG) seeded from a key\cite{otp-faq}.

When encrypting binary data, each bit of the plain-text is XORed with a bit of the generated key-stream.

If you restart the process each time you get the same key-stream each time, as shown in equation~\ref{eq:xor}.

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        P_1 \oplus KS = C_1,\\
        P_2 \oplus KS = C_2,\\
        C_1 \oplus C_2 = P_1 \oplus P_2\label{eq:xor}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

The reason this equality is a problem in cryptography is shown graphically in equation~\ref{eq:img-xor}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        \overbrace{\includegraphics[height=8ex]{img/sendcash1}}^{P_1} \oplus \overbrace{\includegraphics[height=8ex]{img/key1}}^{KS} = \overbrace{\includegraphics[height=8ex]{img/sendcashe}}^{C_1},\\
        \overbrace{\includegraphics[height=8ex]{img/smiley}}^{P_2}    \oplus \overbrace{\includegraphics[height=8ex]{img/key1}}^{KS} =\overbrace{\includegraphics[height=8ex]{img/smileye}}^{C_2},\\
        \overbrace{\includegraphics[height=8ex]{img/sendcashe}}^{C_1} \oplus \overbrace{\includegraphics[height=8ex]{img/smileye}}^{C_2} = \overbrace{\includegraphics[height=8ex]{img/smicash1}}^{P_1 \oplus P_2}\label{eq:img-xor}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
\caption{Graphical explanation of why reusing a keystream is dangerous cryptographically (source \protect\cite{stream-reuse})}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Application of RC4 in WEP}
WEP uses a 40-bit shared key to initialize the same RC4 state for all stations. The reason for using only 40-bits was to comply with US restrictions on exporting cryptography technology\cite{wep-evolution}.

Because RC4 is a stream cipher any missing data would cause a misalignment with the key-stream. Because in wifi frames are expected to be lost the process is restarted each frame.  To prevent key-stream reuse, a random 24-bit Initialization Vector (IV)\label{p:iv} is appended to the shared key.

\subsubsection{Application of CRC32 in WEP}
Every frame includes an Integrity Check Value (ICV) which is the CRC-32 hash of the plain-text, appended to the plain-text.  The receiver re-computes the CRC-32 hash of the message and if it does not match the frame is dropped

\subsubsection{Flaws}

\paragraph{ICV}
The CRC used in the ICV is a poor cryptographic hash because it is a linear function of the message. Check-sum algorithms are ``unsuitable as cryptographic hash functions''\cite{wiki-crc}. Equation~\ref{eq:crc} shows how to calculate the CRC hash of the modified plain-text, without knowing that original plain-text.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:crc}
C'=C \oplus (\Delta ,c(\Delta)),
\end{equation}

Where $C$ is the original CRC, $C'$ is the CRC of the modified data, $\Delta$ is the changes made to the plain-text, and $c(\Delta)$ is the CRC-32 of $\Delta$.

As such an attacker can flip any bit in the cipher-text and correctly adjust the encrypted hash to avoid detection, rendering any data integrity checks pointless.

\paragraph{Small Key Space}
Brute-force attacks on WEP were already practical when the protocol was designed with only 40-bits of key.  The protocol was extended by many manufacturers using a 104-bit key (also called 128-bit because a 104-bit key plus a 24-bit IV totals to 128-bits).  The 104-bit keys operate in exactly the same way as 40-bit keys, except with a longer key.

\paragraph{Key-stream discovery}
RC4 becomes vulnerable if two messages are encrypted using the same key-stream.  As discussed in paragraph~\ref{p:iv} each frame has a random 24-bit Initialization Vector (IV).  Unfortunately due to the very short IV length the probability of an IV being repeated after 4,096 messages becomes likely.

The plain text and key-stream can then be discovered using equation~\ref{eq:xor}.

\paragraph{Frame Injection}
WEP has no anti-replay protection, ie no sequence number unless included in a protocol at another layer eg TCP. As such an attacker can re-use a known IV and key-stream (gained from previous attacks) to generate unlimited valid frames.  An attacker can capture frames and resend them resulting in a Denial of Service or the ability to send other malicious traffic.

\paragraph{Shared Key Recovery}
\textcite{tews2007breaking} published a method to recover a 104-bit shared WEP key ``in less than 60 seconds''  The method uses the predictability of the ARP protocol: first 16 bytes are known because it is the MAC address of the station.
The method XORs known bytes with the cypher text bytes resulting in the first 128 bits of key-stream and IV. With enough ARP packets, the shared key can be determined statistically.
The inventive step is to take advantage of the lack of replay prevention, and broadcast captured ARP requests to get more ARP responses.

\paragraph{The Caffe Latte Attack}
The Caffe Latte attack, proposed by \textcite{cafe}, aims to discover a WEP key without access to the original AP using information from only the client stations that have the WEP key. The attack is so named because of the possibility to sit in a coffee shop and listen to clients.

The steps of the attack involve:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Listen to a PROBE for an access point (AP)
    \item Create fake SSID for the AP
    \item Repeatedly challenge, and de-authenticate target client to force it to generate DHCP and ARP requests
    \item Use Shared Key Recovery to recover the key
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Fixes}
Because of these flaws various proposals have been put forward to reduce the security impact.
\paragraph{WEP2}
Extends shared key and IV to 128 bits. However the system is still vulnerable because it still allows IV re-use and still uses CRC-32 for the ICV.
\paragraph{WEPplus} a proprietary enhancement to WEP by Agere Systems: simply Avoids repeated ``Weak IVs'' in WEP.  Only effective when used at ``both ends'', on both client station and AP. Still doesn't prevent replay attacks.
The system is proprietary so not well used.
\paragraph{Dynamic WEP}
Gives each user a dynamically generated wep key based off a master key. This system was never standardized, proprietary, so not well used. The idea was however carried over into 802.11i.

\paragraph{WPA}
WPA was created with just the minimum support required to buy time to develop WPA2.  Can only use Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), with some ideas from dynamic WEP. TKIP still uses RC4, but with a better implementation:

\begin{itemize}
\item Uses key mixing for shared key and IV
\item Prevents using the same encryption key twice
\item Uses a sequence counter to prevent replay attacks
\end{itemize}

This protocol was carried forward to WPA2 as WPA2-TKIP.

\paragraph{WPA2-AES}
WPA2-AES uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption in CCB mode.
AES is a block cipher, so none of the repeated key attacks apply.  When used with AES, WPA2 is believed to be secure, and is now the recommended wireless security default.
